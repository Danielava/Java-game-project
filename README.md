Description:
 A simple card game with different universal features for card games implemented, such as 
 cards having attack, health, abilities, positions in the deck, hand and on the board. More unique features so far
 is having a random six-sided dice be thrown at the end of each turn that dictates what spells can be used by cards on the board.
 Currently, we plan on having a bot to play against. However, this is subject to change.

To run the game:
 - Clone the repository
 - Put the java files in their correct folder setup.
 - Run the .jar file to run the game.
 - Enjoy!
 
To develop the game:
 We used java version 8 Update 77 (build 1.8.0_77-b03) to develop the game.
 A newer version will likely work. Both eclipse and intelliJ were used as 
 development environments, but mainly intelliJ.

How we test our game:
 Mainly, testing is playing the game ourselves, trying out different combinations of cards.
 We also play against the AI, and construct as many extreme and odd situations possible for
 the computer to react to.
