Our goal is to try and create a very accessible yet strategic card game. 
The basic idea is that you take cards from your deck and put them on the board. 

Each card will have some attacks and all that. The attacks executed are decided by a dice roll. If you roll a 4 on the dice and you have a card on the board with an attackNr 4 that attack will be executed etc. The idea may sound too simple at first but we are trying to come up with how we can make this game more strategic.
