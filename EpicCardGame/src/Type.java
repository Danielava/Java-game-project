/**
 * These are basically our card types in this game.
 * In pokemon these would for example be type fire,
 * water, grass, electric etc. We felt like those
 * types are kind of generic so we wanted to come
 * up with our own unique types
 *
 * It would be natural to think that a card Type would affect
 * gameplay but we still aren't sure about that.
 * What the types will do however is that it will affect the color
 * of the card.
